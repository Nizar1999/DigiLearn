# DigiLearn

Introduction :

In many educational programs, we love many things about E-learning, but oftentimes assessment is not one of those things! There is often concern about accuracy, validity, security, integrity, and quality of software assessment. Yet, computer-based testing offers so many benefits to E-learners, instructors, and programs, mainly in terms of administration, grading, and scale that they deserve a much closer look.
DigiLearn is a java-based program developed to help students learn while interacting with their PC, as well as help teachers create and organize study material for their courses.

DigiLearn Features

Login interface

a.	Users can Sign-up to DigiLearn by creating an account to which their course progress is linked.

b.	Users can login back to their account at any time to resume their learning path.

Security

c.	DigiLearn was built to be secure and trust worthy therefore we took the extra step to encrypt your password so that no one other than you can access your account.

d.	We developed our own encryption algorithm so that once your password is saved to a text file, it will be unrecognizable and impossible to decrypt because we used a Hashing like algorithm usually used to store hashed passwords in databases.

Course Creator 

e.	DigiLearn wasn’t developed for students only, we took into consideration teachers too. We wanted to help teachers while making their courses and quizzes, therefore while developing DigiLearn, we decided to integrate a course creator which makes the life of teachers that much easier.

f.	If you are worried about your students not being compatible with text-based questions, we got you covered. Image based question are now a click away all you must do is choose the images you want, and we will take care of the rest (copying, resizing and format conversion (JPEGPNG)).

g.	Even more customization is possible with DigiLearn. Questions are not challenging enough for some students? No worries, DigiLearn has you covered with multiple difficulty questions.Teachers are able to create three variants(Easy, Medium, or Hard) for each question so that students get to be challenged depending on their level.

Dynamic representation of courses

h.	DigiLearn has been developed to make your life easier not harder. That is why DigiLearn was made to be dynamic in representing courses and their content.

i.	Users can simply copy the course folder and paste it on another computer then add the name of the folder to the Metadata text file in the DigiLearn directory, and just like that the course has been transferred to a new PC. 
Progress tracking 

j.	Are you worried that you’ll lose track of your progress while on your learning journey? Well guess what, DigiLearn got you covered again. We integrated a progress bar on main pages so you can keep track of your progress. Not only that, but your progress is linked to your account, so that the next time you log in, everything will be there waiting for you to resume your learning journey.

Simple user interface 

k.	DigiLearn does a lot of important stuff but it does it elegantly,” Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication” -L.DaVinci . This is the way we developed our application to be simple and effective so everyone can use it. Education should not be obstructed by a complicated interface
